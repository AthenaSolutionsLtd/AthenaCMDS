# AthenaCMDS

AthenaHandler is a fork of [Worn Off Keys](https://youtube.com/wornoffkeys)'s WOKCommands. The goal of WOKCommand is to make it simple and easy to get your bot off the ground without worrying about your own command handler; however, seeing as the handler has gone a long time without updates, Athena Solutions decided to fork it and modify it here and there, to fit our needs.

All credit for the code goes to Worn Off Keys and Alexzander Flores. Credit for the modifications goes to Athena Solutions. Copyrighted under the MIT License, available at `LICENSE`.

AthenaCMDS makes use of [The Better Logger](https://github.com/rsley/thebetterlogger), modified for Typescript and set up for this project, with the developer's permission.

# Documentation

The official documentation for WOKCommand can be found here: https://docs.wornoffkeys.com

- We have tried to leave these parts untouched, Athena Solutions will not bother making separate documentation at this time.
