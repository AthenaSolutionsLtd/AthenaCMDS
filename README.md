# AthenaHandler
AthenaHandler is a fork of [Worn Off Keys](https://youtube.com/wornoffkeys)'s WOKCommands. The goal of WOKCommand is to make it simple and easy to get your bot off the ground without worrying about your own command handler; however, seeing as the handler has gone a long time without updates, Athena Solutions decided to fork it and modify it here and there, to fit our needs.

# Documentation

The official documentation for WOKCommand can be found here: https://docs.wornoffkeys.com
- We have tried to leave these parts untouched, Athena Solutions will not bother making separate documentation at this time.

# Installation

**Yarn**

```bash
yarn add athenahandler
```

# Support & Feature Requests

Athena Solutions is constantly looking for feature requests, suggestions, and to provide help, not only for Athena, but also for this handler. Feel free to drop by the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VjW5F9wmQj)
